## Usage
- Copy the folder MinhThu_curve_tool to this directory: C:\Users\YourName\OneDrive\Documents\maya\scripts
- Open file Curve_Tool_Launch.py in maya script editor and run it.
## General notes
- The size of the curve can't be changed.
- *arrow_circle* and *triangle* options are broken, I'm working on it.
- It's dockable.
## Release notes
Mar. 31, 2025: Fixed the issue of PySide importing in Maya 2025.
## Troubleshooting
- If there is any issues with PySide importing in previous versions of Maya, go to MinhThu_curve_tool/ui/dialogs/curve_maker_dialog. In line 2 you should see
```
import PySide6 as QT
```
change it into
```
import PySide2 as QT
```
If it's still not working please feel free to let me know!
